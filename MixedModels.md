*Mixed* (or *mixed-effect*) *models* are a broad class of statistical models used to analyze data where observations can be assigned *a priori* to discrete groups, and where the parameters describing the differences between groups are treated as random (or *latent*) variables. They are one category of *multilevel*, or *hierarchical* models; *longitudinal* data are often analyzed in this framework. In econometrics, longitudinal or cross-sectional time series data are often referred to as *panel data* and are sometimes fitted with mixed models.  Mixed models can be fitted in either frequentist or Bayesian frameworks.

This task view only includes models that incorporate *continuous* (usually although not always Gaussian) latent variables. This excludes packages that handle hidden Markov models, latent Markov models, and finite (discrete) mixture models (some of these are covered by the `r view("Cluster")` task view). Dynamic linear models and other state-space models that do not incorporate a discrete grouping variable are also excluded (some of these are covered by the `r view("TimeSeries")` task view). Bioinformatic applications of [mixed models hosted on Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/help/search/index.html?q="mixed+models"/) are mostly excluded as well.


### Basic model fitting

#### Linear mixed models

Linear mixed models (LMMs) make the following assumptions:

- The expected values of the responses are linear combinations of the fixed predictor variables and the random effects.
- The conditional distribution of the responses is Gaussian (equivalently, the errors are Gaussian).
- The random effects are normally distributed.

*Frequentist:*

The most commonly used packages and/or functions for frequentist LMMs are:

- `r pkg("nlme", priority = "core")`: `nlme::lme()` provides REML or ML estimation. Allows multiple nested random effects, and provides structures for modeling heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors. Wald estimates of parameter uncertainty.
- `r pkg("lme4", priority = "core")`: `lmer4::lmer()` provides REML or ML estimation. Allows multiple nested or crossed random effects, can compute profile confidence intervals and conduct parametric bootstrapping.
- `r pkg("mbest")`: fits large nested LMMs using a fast moment-based approach.

*Bayesian:*

Most Bayesian R packages use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation: `r pkg("MCMCglmm", priority = "core")`, `r pkg("rstanarm")`, and `r pkg("brms", priority = "core")`; the latter two packages use the [Stan](mc-stan.org) infrastructure. `r pkg("blme")`, built on `r pkg("lme4", priority = "core")`, uses maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. `r pkg("bamlss")` provides a flexible set of modular functions for Bayesian regression modeling.

#### Generalized linear mixed models

Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) can be described as hierarchical extensions of generalized linear models (GLMs), or as extensions of LMMs to different response distributions, typically in the exponential family. The random-effect distributions are typically assumed to be Gaussian on the scale of the linear predictor.

*Frequentist:*

- `r pkg("MASS")`: `MASS::glmmPQL()` fits via penalized quasi-likelihood.
- `r pkg("lme4", priority = "core")`: `lme4::glmer()` uses Laplace approximation and adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature; fits negative binomial as well as exponential-family models.
- `r pkg("glmmTMB", priority = "core")` uses Laplace approximation; allows some correlation structures; fits some non-exponential families (Beta, COM-Poisson, etc.) and zero-inflated/hurdle models.
- `r pkg("GLMMadaptive")` uses adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature; fits exponential family, negative binomial, beta, zero-inflated/hurdle/censored Gaussian models, user-specified log-densities.
- `r pkg("hglm")` fits hierarchical GLMs using $h$-likelihood (*sensu* Nelder, Lee and Pawitan (2017)
- `r pkg("glmm")` fits GLMMs using Monte Carlo likelihood approximation.
- `r pkg("glmmEP")` fits probit mixed models for binary data by expectation propagation.
- `r pkg("mbest")` fits large nested GLMMs using a fast moment-based approach.
- `r pkg("galamm")` fits a wide variety of models (heteroscedastic, mixed response types, factor loadings, etc.)
- `r pkg("glmmrBase")` uses MCMC and Laplace approximations to Gaussian, binomial, Poisson, Beta, Gamma responses with flexible correlation structures

*Bayesian:*

Most Bayesian mixed model packages use some form of Markov chain Monte Carlo (or other Monte Carlo methods).

- `r pkg("MCMCglmm", priority = "core")`: Gibbs sampling. Exponential family, multinomial, ordinal, zero-inflated/altered/hurdle, censored, multimembership, multi-response models. Pedigree (animal/kinship/phylogenetic) models.
- `r pkg("rstanarm")` Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (based on [Stan](http://mc-stan.org)); designed for `lme4` compatibility.
- `r pkg("brms", priority = "core")`: Hamilton Monte Carlo. Linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated/hurdle/censored data.
- `r pkg("bamlss")`: optimization and derivative-based Metropolis-Hastings/slice sampling. Wide range of distributions and link functions.

The following packages (in addition to `r pkg("bamlss")`) find maximum *a posteriori* fits to Bayesian (G)LMMs by optimization:

- `r pkg("blme")` wraps `r pkg("lme4", priority = "core")` to add prior distributions.
- [INLA](https://www.r-inla.org) uses integrated nested Laplace approximation to fit GLMMs using a  wide range of latent models (especially for spatial estimation), priors, and distributions.
- `r pkg("inlabru")` facilitates spatial modeling using integrated nested Laplace approximation via the R-INLA package. Additionally, extends the GAM-like model class to more general nonlinear predictor expressions and implements a log-Gaussian Cox process likelihood for modeling univariate and spatial point processes based on ecological survey data.
- `r github("inbo/inlatools")` provides tools to set sensible priors and check the dispersion and distribution of INLA models.
- `r pkg("vglmer")` estimates GLMMs by variational Bayesian methods.

#### Nonlinear mixed models

Nonlinear mixed models incorporate arbitrary nonlinear responses that cannot be accommodated in the framework of GLMMs. Only a few packages can accommodate *generalized* nonlinear mixed models (i.e., parametric nonlinear mixed models with non-Gaussian responses). However, many packages allow smooth nonparametric components (see ["Additive models"](#additive-models) below). Otherwise, users may need to implement GNLMMs themselves in a more general [hierarchical modeling framework](#hierarchical-modeling-frameworks).

*Frequentist:*

- `nlme::nlme()` from `r pkg("nlme")` and `lmer4::nlmer()` from `r pkg("lme4", priority = "core")` fit nonlinear mixed effects models by maximum likelihood.
- `nlmixr2est::nlmixr2()` from `r pkg("nlmixr2")` fits nonlinear mixed effects model by a first order conditional estimation (FOCEi) maximum likelihood approximation (a different approximation than `nlme::nlme()` and `lmer4::nlmer()`), and allows generalized likelihood as well as a selection of built-in link functions (using `est="focei"`).
- `nlmixr2est::nlmixr2()` can also use the approximation of `nlme::nlme` with `est="nlme"`.
- `gnlmm()` and `gnlmm3()` from `r pkg("repeated")` fit GNLMMs by Gauss-Hermite integration.
- `r pkg("saemix")` and `r pkg("nlmixr2")` both use a stochastic approximation of the EM algorithm to fit a wide range of GNLMMs.


*Bayesian:*

- `r pkg("brms")` supports GNLMMs.

#### Generalized estimating equations

General estimating equations (GEEs) are an alternative approach to fitting clustered, longitudinal, or otherwise correlated data. These models produce estimates of the *marginal* effects (averaged across the group-level variation) rather than *conditional* effects (conditioned on group-level information).

- `r pkg("geepack", priority = "core")`, `r pkg("gee")`, and `r pkg("geeM")` are standard GEE solvers, providing GEE estimation of the parameters in mean structures with possible correlation between the outcomes.
- `r pkg("geesmv")`: GEE estimator using the original sandwich variance estimator proposed by Liang and Zeger (1986), and eight types of variance estimators for improving the finite small-sample performance.
- `r pkg("multgee")` is a GEE solver for correlated nominal or ordinal multinomial responses.
- `r pkg("glmtoolbox")` handles a wide variety of model types (GLMs, beta-binomial and negative binomial, zero-inflation and zero-alteration, mixed models) via GEEs

### Hierarchical modeling frameworks

These packages do not directly provide functions to fit mixed models, but instead implement interfaces to general-purpose sampling and optimization toolboxes that can be used to fit mixed models. While models require extra effort to set up, and often require programming in a domain-specific language other than R, these frameworks are more flexible than most of the other packages listed here.

* Interfaces to [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/)/[OpenBUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/openbugs/): `r pkg("R2jags")`, `r pkg("rjags")`, `r pkg("R2OpenBUGS")` (BUGS language).
* Interfaces to [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) (C++ extensions): `r pkg("rstan")`, `r github("stan-dev/cmdstanr")`, `r github("rmcelreath/rethinking")` (`ulam()` function).

### Commercial software interfaces

- [Mplus](https://www.statmodel.com/): `r pkg("MplusAutomation")`.
- [ASReml-R](https://vsni.co.uk/software/asreml-r): `r pkg("asremlPlus")`.
- `r pkg("babelmixr2")` allows `r pkg("nlmixr2")` models to be translated and run in either the commercial tool
  [Monolix](https://monolix.lixoft.com/) or [NONMEM](https://www.iconplc.com/solutions/technologies/nonmem) and then reads the results
  back in to create a standardized `nlmixr2` fit object. This fit object runs the diagnostics in `nlmixr2` and compares them
  to the ones output in the commercial software to "validate" the fit object against the output of the commercial tool.
  It also interfaces with free tools such as:  `r pkg("PKNCA")` for automatically using observed pharmacokinetic (PK) data
  for initial estimates of PK models and `r pkg("PopED")` for using nonlinear mixed models in optimal design.
